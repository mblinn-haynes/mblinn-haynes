## Hi👋, I'm Marcus 

I'm a **Software Engineer** based in the UK

I like to design and build creative solutions to problems either as in individual or with a group.

I've leveraged my education in Computer Science from the University of Plymouth to develop my own programs and applications.

 ✨ Currently open to new opportunities ✨
