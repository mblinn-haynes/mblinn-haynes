## Hi there 👋

I'm Marcus, a software engineer based in the UK

I like to design and build creative solutions to problems either as in individual or with a group.

I've leveraged my education in Computer Science from the University of Plymouth to develop my own programs and applications.

I'm currently open to new opportunities
